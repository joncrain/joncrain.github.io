### **Professional Experience**

#### **Application Administrator, Central Michigan University**

##### **December 2011 – Present**

As an application administrator I am a jack of all trades. I am primarily
responsible for our third party on site hosted applications, but I have my hands
on many projects around the office and can spend time in specific areas as needed.
Working with a great team and more mature processes allowed me to develop my
skills in lots of interesting areas. I have
lately been working fairly closely on our client deployment and management processes
and have revamped our use of Munki, AutoPkg, DeployStudio and puppet.

The coordinator position was a grant funded role that was created to aid in starting the
recording label White Pine Music. While I did record and
mix from time to time, my primary role was to alleviate some of the IT challenges that
were put on the Audio Production Manager at the School of Music. Together, we managed around
120 Mac computers for Faculty/Staff and labs. The position was funded for three years at
which point they wanted to keep me on, but could only fit a part time role into the budget.

#### **IT/Production Director, Grace Church – Mount Pleasant, MI**

##### **May 2003 – February 2006**

This was my first taste of an IT role. My primary role was in production, but because of
limited resources, I put a lot of time into learning how to manage computers. We had
a network of around 20 to 30 Macs and I can still remember the debates on transitioning
from OS9 to Mac OSX (which if you don't remember, was not real great until 10.3 or so).
I have fond memories of many late night working with many great friends here a lot of
whom got there professional career path altered or tweaked while serving in this church.

### **Freelance Work**

#### **Computer Support, Isabella Community Sportsplex - Mount Pleasant, MI**

##### **January 2010 - Present**

I was fortunate to take over work with the Sportsplex from a friend of mine who was moving out of the
area in 2010. The Sportsplex has grown to include Morey Courts, the MP ICE Arena and McLaren Fitness.
I have been able to consolidate a lot of the backend of their technologies and have provisioned
many great technical resources that are available to nonprofits for their use (Azure for Nonprofits, AdWord Grants,
G Suite for Nonprofits, Slack, Github, etc.). This has been a win-win
as it has allowed me to broaden my skills to areas that I do not do in my full time role.
