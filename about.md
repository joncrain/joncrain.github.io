![workspace]({{ site.url }}/images/workspace.jpg)

My name is Jon Crain. I have worked on device endpoint management in many various roles. From small non-profits with a few Macs to large higher ed and enterprise deploymnents. My focus has been on utilizing open source tooling and developing user focused onboarding and security.

I have spoken at various conferences over the past few years including [MacDevOpsYVR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q0NL04co5U) and [Penn State MacAdmins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtWNBn76LQM) and am an active member of the [MacAdmins Slack community](https://www.macadmins.org).
