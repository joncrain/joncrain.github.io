# About

![workspace]({{ site.url }}/images/workspace.jpg)

My name is Jon Crain. I do a lot of work on Macs. 

And by work, I mean like automating all the things for a mid-sized fleet of macOS machines. 

And by things, I mean things like application deployments and package building. But it's more than that. There is a lot of planning, communication and thought that goes into it as well.

I also wrangle with MDM and DEP and other things of that nature that Apple thinks we need.

Left to my own, I would just use Munki and puppet/chef, but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

If you would like to contact me, the ~~easiest~~ best way is to chat in the MacAdmins Slack. That is if you want to chat about stuff talked about on this site. Otherwise, I'm sure you can find some way.
