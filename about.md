## Coaching

I have coached at Mount Pleasant High School for the past nine years. I started out
assisting, but quickly became the JV head coach where I worked with the boys program
for eight seasons and the girls program for five. In 2015, I stepped into the head
coaching position for the boys varsity team.

Coaching gives me the opportunity to stretch my life in areas that I may not naturally
look to grow. In my day job I sit at a computer for nearly 8 hours a day. Coaching
forces me to get outside everyday and get some fresh air. It also allows me to get to
know so many different families that I would not otherwise have the opportunity to
interact with. It also stretches my team building skills. I am far from a perfect
coach, but I enjoy the challenge in this non technical area of my life.

For over ten years of my life, I identified myself as a guitarist. While I still
like to think I can play, I definitely don't have the time to put in it that I
once had.
